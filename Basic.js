 /* Node.js def:-- node.js is not a programming language or framwork,it is a simple javaScript runtime environment that allows developer to run javaScript outside of a browser. 
    * features:- 1.open source: source code of node is publicaly available on github and anyone access ,view and modify means you are a contributer to make node.
        2. cross platform: node js run on any os.
        3. javaScript runtime Environment: simply we run javaScript code in browsers but this feature provides a environment to run javaScript code in node js.
        * why?==node.js uses google chromes V8 engine to compile javascript into machine code.making it lightning-fast.
        and developer can use javaScript for both frontend and backend ,reducing complexity.
        * where it use:netflix,linkedIn,paypal,uber,trello.
        * History And Evolution:--creation (2009)-Ryan Dahl.
        then in 2010:-create npm(npm is a package manager):-npm contains pakages like:1.Express.js
                                                                                    2.Mongoose
                                                                                    3.Axios
                                                                                    4.React
                                                                                    5.socket.io and many packages conatins.
        merger of Node.js and io.js(2015):-the new feature in io.js is not use any one because node.js is get famaous so merge the node and io.js for fast performance.
        
        * REPL(Read-Eval-Print-Loop):- when we write node on terminal then we give javaScript environment where we can write simple javaScript code rither than use browser it is called REPL means simple it reads the data and pass to v8 engine and execute.
        * Module:-module is same as the components in react.js ,when we create seperate file like demo.js this file acts as module ,and we until and unless export we dont access outside .
